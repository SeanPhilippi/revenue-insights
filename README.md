# revenue-insights

## Project Commands


In root directory (revenue-insights): `npm i`

Then start the app: `npm start`

## Notes


The project should open a window in your browser at http://localhost:3000, if not visit that address to see the project.

The insights.csv data is in /public.  I added some data to the beginning and end to have more data to work with and make sure all my filters were working as intended.
